    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <img src="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151692731010590&set=a.468223130589.269000.608460589&type=3&theater">

    <p>My name is Shreya Patel, and I am currently a student living in Atlanta Georgia.  I moved here from New Jersey about 6 years ago.  In my free time I enjoy hiking at different parks, and I generally love being outdoors.  I also love the arts and I although I enjoy all forms of art and expression, I have always loved design and in my spare time I make clothes.</p>

    <h1>My Background</h1>

    <p> I began college years ago and my original plan was to become a dentist.  I soon realized that I did not want to pursue this career path any longer, and so I began to transition into the business environment.  In doing so, I realized that what I really wanted to do was forge a career in programming in computer science. </p>

    <h1>Why I Decided to Learn Progamming?</h1>

    <p> When I realized that a career in the healthcare industry was not for me, I felt lost for a while, I had counted on this one plan for so long, and I did not know what was next.  I had completed some business courses during my undergraduate education, and so I decided to change my major to business.  In obtaining a part time job as an administrative office assistant, as much as I enjoyed the job and the environment, I still was unsatisfied.  I started to learn some programming through free online resources, and upon doing, I immediately knew that this was the career for me.  I thoroughly enjoyed what I was doing, and I constantly wanted to know more.  I spent a few weeks researching different programming courses, and I am now excited to further my education through Coder Camps.</p>
